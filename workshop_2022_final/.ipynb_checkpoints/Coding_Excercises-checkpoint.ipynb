    "Welcome to the Python Coding Bootcamp for the TAURUS/REU. We are super excited to have you all here these 10 weeks and help foster your growth in coding. Coding is everywhere nowadays but even more so in astronomy research as coding is the main way that we analyze data, generate results and make some pretty awesome pictures that show off our results. We aim to help you build your confidence with coding in Python and teach you the necessary skills required to be self sufficient and to think like a researcher. \n",
    "\n",
    "These coding exercises are designed to test the fundamentals of coding that everyone must have. We have it split up into different days with each day building in complexity. We ask that you work through this and try to do as much as you can. The day that you are having trouble in will be the day that you will start our bootcamp. So if you are finding Day 3 exercises to be a bit much but passed all of Day 2, we will ask that before you start the Day 3 notebooks to finish the challenge exercises in Day 2 and that you get signed off by any of the instructors to proceed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try your best and if you are stuck we are here to help out :D!"
