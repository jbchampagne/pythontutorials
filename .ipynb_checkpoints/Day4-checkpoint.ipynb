    "A package I highly recommend you become familiar with is astropy. This includes a library of astronomical constants and unit conversions, coordinate conversions, cosmological calculations, image processing, and much more! There are many components of astropy that we won't be able to cover, but as a sneak peak you can deal with tables of data, measuring photometry, and processing psfs in images. See more here: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html\n",

If it is a large, well-known package (i.e., not developed by one person on github), you can usually install things using pip. Go ahead and open a terminal session. Once you are in bash and your Python 3.5 environment, type\n",

    "## Astropy: Units & Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic use for Astropy is units and constants. I highly recommend using the constants within Astropy so that a) you're not constantly Googling them, and b) they are precise and accurate. The constants are loaded with units as well, making conversions between them quite easy.\n",
