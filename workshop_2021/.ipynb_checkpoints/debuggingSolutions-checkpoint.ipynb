    "Explanation: Nothing is wrong with the code. This example shows some of the nuance involved with objects. In a nutshell, list1 has both data (what's in the []) and methods associated with it, like list1.append() . This would be pretty cumbersome to move around in memory so list1 is sort of split up. By saying list2 = list1, it's saying those are identical, and any updates to list1 or list2 via calling a list method, like append() are reflected in both list1 and list2. In contrast, list1 =[] has now severed the link between list1 and list2, list2 still has the original list1 data whereas the new list1 has nothing. Thesea are why both equalities fail."
