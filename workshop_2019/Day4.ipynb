    "\n",
    "This leads us to a great opportunity to show you how to install additional packages to your Python distribution. If it is a large, well-known package (i.e., not developed by one person on github), you can usually install things using pip. Go ahead and open a terminal session. Once you are in bash and your Python 3.5 environment, type\n",

    "The most basic use for Astropy is units and constants. I highly recommend using the constants within Astropy so that a) you're not constantly Googling them, and b) they are precise and accurate. The constants are loaded with units as well, making conversions between them quite easy.\n",

    "One quick disclaimer is that the solar mass constant is slightly out of date, so researchers doing high-precision stellar work may need to keep that in mind.\n",
